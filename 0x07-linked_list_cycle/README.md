# 0x07-linked_list_cycle
For this interview practice algorithm, there is a singly linked list that may or may not contain a cycle.

[Linked List Cycle](/0x07-linked_list_cycle/0-check_cycle.c)
* Write a function in C `int check_cycle(listing_t *list)` that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it:
  * Returns `0` if there is no cycle, `1` if there is a cycle
  * Only the following functions are allowed: `write`, `printf`, `putchar`, `puts`, `malloc`, `free`

### test_files
The test_files/ directory contains files used to test the output of the algorithm locally, as well as all given source code such as the header file and functions to build, print, and free the list to be used to compile the program.
