# 0x0E-linear_skip
This interview algorithm project utilizes a skip list.  Skip lists optimize looking for a specific value, which typically requires visiting every element in a singly linked list, by including an "express lane" that moves through the list faster.

[Linear Search in a Skip List](/0x0E-linear_skip/0-linear_skip.c)
* Write a function in C `skiplist_t *linear_skip(skiplist_t *list, int value)` that searches for a value in a sorted skip list of integers:
  * `list` is a pointer to the head of the sorted skip list to search in
  * `list` is sorted in ascending order
  * prints the current element every time it is compared to `value`
  * returns a pointer to the first node where `value` is located or `NULL` if the value is not present or `head` is `NULL`

### test_files
The test_files/ directory contains files used to test the output of the algorithm locally, as well as all given source code such as the struct and functions needed to compile the main program for testing.
