# 0x0D-sorted_array_to_avl
AVL trees are used in this practice interview algorithm.  AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees.

[AVL - from sorted array](/0x0D-sorted_array_to_avl)
* Write a function in C `avl_t *sorted_array_to_avl(int *array, size_t size)` that builds an AVL tree from a sorted array:
  * Returns a pointer to the root node of the created AVL tree, or `NULL` on failure
  * It can be assumed there are no duplicate values in the array.
  * Rotation of the AVL tree is not allowed.
  * There can only be a maximum of 2 helper fuctions (3 functions total in the file)

### test_files
The test_files/ directory contains files used to test the output of the algorithm locally, as well as all given source code such as the struct and function to print the AVL tree.
