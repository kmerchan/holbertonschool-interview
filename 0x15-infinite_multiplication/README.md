# 0x15-infinite_multiplication
This interview algorithm project multiplies two positive numbers.

[Infinite Multiplication](/0x15-infinite_multiplication/0-mul.c)
* Write a program in C that multiplies two positive numbers `./mul num1 num2`:
  * `num1` and `num2` will be passed in base 10
  * The result should be printed to the standard output, followed by a new line.

### test_files
The test_files/ directory contains files used to test the output of the algorithm locally, as well as all given source code such as _putchar.
