# 0x10-rain
This interview algorithm project uses a list of non-negative integers to represent walls of width 1. The ends of the list are not walls.

[Rain](/0x10-rain/0-rain.py)
* Write a function in Python `def rain(walls)` that calculates how much water will be retained after it rains when given a list representing walls:
  * `walls` is list of non-negative integers
  * returns an integer representing the total amount of rainwater retained
  * if the list is empty, return 0

### test_files
The test_files/ directory contains files used to test the output of the algorithm locally.
