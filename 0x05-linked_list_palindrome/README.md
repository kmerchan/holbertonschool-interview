# 0x05-linked_list_palindrome
For this interview practice algorithm, check to see if the given singly linked list is a palindrome.

[Linked List Palindrome](/0x05-linked_list_palindrome/0-is_palindrome.c)
* Write a function in C `int is_palindrome(listint_t **head)` that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome:
  * `head` is a pointer to the head of the singly linked list to check
  * Returns 0 if it is not a palindrome and 1 if it is
  * An empty list is considered a palindrome

### test_files
The test_files/ directory contains files used to test the output of the algorithm locally and all given source code for reference, including the lists.h header file.
